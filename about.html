  <h1>Our Approach</h1>
  <p>Anonymous Reporting for Border Crossings Through our anonymous reporting mechanism we crowd-source data to map incidents of harassment and corruption at border crossings across East Africa. 
  </P>
  <p>Empowering Africa's Cross-Border Traders with the Right Information We work with civil society organisations to use data collected through our platform for evidence-based advocacy at community, national and regional levels. 
  </P>
  <p>Driving Advocacy and Partnerships Traders can use our number to find out what documentation, taxes and tariffs are applicable to their products, and receive regular updates on changes to border procedures.
  </P>
  <p>Triggering Change Sauti means voice in Swahili and our mission is to empower cross-border traders to exercise their rights as citizens of the East African Community – able to trade freely and safely across borders and stand up for their rights with a loud and clear voice. 
  </P>
</div>

<div class="plan">
  <h1>Our Plan Of Action</h1>
  <p>Thanks to the generous support of our partners, we are expanding our services to border crossings across the whole East African Community.
